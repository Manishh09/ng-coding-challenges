- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Angular developers.
- **List some other projects where this enhancement exists.**

### Adding New Challenges

We welcome contributions of new coding challenges. To add a new challenge:

1. Create a new branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b add-challenge-[challenge-name]`
2. Follow the challenge structure pattern in the existing challenges
3. Create a new folder in `projects/` with the pattern `challenge-XX-name-of-challenge`
4. Include a detailed `CH-XX-REQUIREMENT.md` file following the format used in existing challenges
5. Add a starter implementation with appropriate placeholder comments
6. Update the challenge list in the main application
7. Submit a pull request with your changes

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible learning resource
- Enable a sustainable system for the project's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the PR template [Pull Request Template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing
3. If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ng-coding-challenges.git

# navigate to project
cd ng-coding-challenges


#checkout develop
git checkout develop

#pull changes
git pull
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# if any issues, remove package-lock.json file and run `npm install`
```

4. Create a branch for your feature or bugfix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

5. Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive commit message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
```

6. Push your branch to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

7. Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository (develop branch)

### Running Tests

Before submitting a pull request, make sure all tests pass:
